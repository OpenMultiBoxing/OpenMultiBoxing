Extract all the files into any same normal folder (not Program Files or system folders).

You can launch your game windows normally and OMB will place them where you've setup
in the Windows Layout Wizard, or for games like wow, you can also:

Right click edit and configure launchwow.bat to match your desires, if you prefer
that to using Battle.net launcher (see links above for tradeoffs). Make multiple copies
for different sets of teams and change the TEAM variable value to make it unique.
(see the other .bat files for classic and legacy launcher examples)
